The package \ty{gin} contains programs for investigating the
functional content of genome intervals. The package consists of three
programs, \ty{annotate} annotates a set of intervals, \ty{shuffle}
shuffles a set of intervals, and \ty{ego} tests for GO term enrichment
among an observed set of gene symbols.

To use these programs, first annotate a list of intervals and from
that compute the observed list of gene symbols:
\begin{verbatim}
$ annotate -s hsRefGene.txt i1.txt | 
awk '{print $4}' | 
tr ',' '\n' > obsSym.txt
\end{verbatim}

Now test for enrichment of GO terms among the symbols contained
in \ty{obsSym.txt}:
\begin{verbatim}
$ shuffle -n 100000 hsTmpl.txt i1.txt |
annotate -s hsRefGene.txt |
awk '/^#/&&NR>1{print ""}!/^#/{print $4}' |
tr ',' '\n' |
ego -i Homo_sapiens.gene_info -g gene2go obsSym.txt
\end{verbatim}
